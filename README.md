Job List Software GitHub page.

I have set this up so that I can see issues and things to do as they appear without having to log into RDP and then Ostendo. There is no code posted here. It also provides a better and more standard way of reporting issues in the software, much makes reading and commenting on individual issues much easier.

Click on the "Issues" tab above to get started. There you will find a demonstration issue that I have created to illustrate how to post an issue.
